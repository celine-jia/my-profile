				Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, often shortened to Hogwarts, is the British wizarding school, located in the Scottish Highlands. We accept magical students from the whole world for enrolment. We are a state-owned school, funded by the Ministry of Magic. We are considered to be one of the finest magical institutions in the wizarding world, though other notable schools included Beauxbatons Academy of Magic in France, the Durmstrang Institute implied to be in northern Europe, and Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the United States.

    	<h2>The houses</h2>
    	<p>
    		The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your House points, while any rule breaking will lose House points. At the end of the year, the House with the most points is awarded the House Cup, a great honour.

    	<p>
    		You are a Muggle-born or a half-blood with no knowledge of the wizarding world? Don't worry. A staff member from the school will visit you and your family in order to inform you of your magical heritage and the existence of the wizarding world.
